# AP2.1
a collection of ipython3 notebooks for the "Anf√§ngerpraktikum 2.1" at Uni Heidelberg. 
No guarantee on any results though!

I'm trying to follow the basic python coding guidelines.
If you don't understand what a function does or what my script does, feel free to ask and I'll add more comments
Also, new implementations may also be included, if you tell me what you want.
(Keep in mind that I'm quite busy with $stuff, so adding other features might take some time)
